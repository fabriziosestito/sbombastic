# SBOMbastic

A SBOM-centric security scanner for Kubernetes.

This is still being developed. For additional details, please refer to the [RFC](docs/rfc).

# Development

## Run tests

```shell
make test
```

## Run the development environment with Tilt

Customize `tilt-settings.yaml` to your needs.
If running from scratch with default settings, you need to create a PersistentVolume (PV) matching the PVC specs for SQLite data persistence. See `examples/pv.yaml` for reference.

Run tilt:

```shell
tilt up
```

Run tilt with unified logs:

```shell
tilt up --stream
```

Follow controller logs:

```shell
tilt logs -f controller
```

Follow storage logs:

```shell
tilt logs -f storage
```

Follow worker logs:

```shell
tilt logs -f worker
```

Teardown the environment:

```shell
tilt down
```

## Generate code

When you make changes to the CRDs in `/api` or rbac rules annotations, you need to regenerate the code.

```shell
make generate
```

# Credits

The storage API server is based on the [Kubernetes sample-apiserver](https://github.com/kubernetes/sample-apiserver) project.
